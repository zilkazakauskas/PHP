A binary code represents text, computer processor instructions, or any other data using a two-symbol system. The two-symbol system used is often "0" and "1" from the binary number system. The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits, also known as bits, to each character, instruction, etc.

Octal refers to the base-8 numbering system. It comes from the Latin word for eight. The octal numbering system uses the numerals 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7. In computing environments, it is commonly used as a shorter representation of binary numbers by grouping binary digits into threes.

Hexadecimal numeral system is a positional numeral system that represents numbers using a radix (base) of 16. Unlike the common way of representing numbers using 10 symbols, hexadecimal uses 16 distinct symbols, most often the symbols "0"–"9" to represent values 0 to 9, and "A"–"F" (or alternatively "a"–"f") to represent values 10 to 15
